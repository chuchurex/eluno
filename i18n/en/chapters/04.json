Increasingly, entities incarnating upon your sphere are nascent fourth density beings, entering bodies that carry characteristics of both third and fourth density — what have been called {term:dual-activated-bodies}. They have come as pioneers, attempting to express fourth density understanding within the environment you now experience."

Soon it will be vibrating fully in fourth density. Those who have chosen — who have achieved sufficient {term:polarity} toward service to others or service to self — will continue their evolution in appropriate environments. Those who have not chosen will find other third density planets upon which to continue their learning."

These are not punishments but processes, natural consequences of the great transition underway."

Three full cycles of third density upon Earth, each ending without sufficient harvest. The repeated distortion of every teaching offered. And yet — the opportunity remains. The choice is still available. The harvest is still open. This, perhaps, is the most remarkable feature of your moment: that after so much apparent failure, the door has not closed."

Toward what do you direct the energy of your being — toward the self alone, or toward the other selves who are, in truth, the same self wearing different faces?"
