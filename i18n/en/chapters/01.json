Unity, at any approximation of understanding, cannot be fully specified by any physics or any philosophy. It can only be activated, potentiated, through the catalyst of free will. However much is understood about the structure of creation, there remains a core of irreducible mystery. The Infinite, by its very nature, cannot be fully comprehended by any individualized portion of itself."

Yet even this infinity of experience is understood to be cyclical, and the nature of that cycle is clad in mystery. There is impressed upon all seekers, by their own teachers, that a mystery-clad unity of creation exists in which all consciousness periodically coalesces and again begins. The progression is infinite and yet it returns."
