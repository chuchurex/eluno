There is no personal element, no exchange between unique beings. At orange and yellow ray, sexuality becomes personal but often distorted. One entity may be seen as object rather than other-self. Power dynamics enter. There can be insatiable appetite that finds no satisfaction, for what these levels seek is green-ray connection."

The receptive partner draws energy upward through the centers, experiencing physical revitalization. The radiative partner finds inspiration that satisfies and feeds the spirit. Both polarize. Both release excess energy that each carries in abundance by nature. This is the first genuine transfer — mutual, loving, and beneficial to the evolution of both."

This is the sacred marriage of which the mystics speak — the union that opens the door to the Creator. Such transfer is extremely rare, for it requires that both entities be completely ready for this energy. If one is not, the transfer simply cannot occur. There is no blockage, but there is no connection. It is as if the distributor were removed from a powerful engine."

In every act of healing, in every moment of genuine teaching, in every encounter where one being is truly present to another, energy moves. The healer who works through green ray and above offers the recipient a gift of organized, coherent light. The teacher whose blue ray is clear communicates not just information but the vibration of authentic being. These transfers polarize the giver and offer the receiver an opportunity — never a guarantee, but an open door through which they may walk if they choose."

Yet at a certain point — in sixth density — the path becomes unsustainable. The accumulated distortions of separation must be released, the heart must open, and the entity must join those it had long considered separate. This is the reversal we have spoken of elsewhere. It is built into the architecture of the system itself."
