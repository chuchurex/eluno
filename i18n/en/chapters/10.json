It experiences them fully, observes them, and through conscious practice discovers their antitheses within the being. The objective is not the smooth flow of feelings while remaining unswayed. The objective is to become unswayed -- to see all things as love. This seeing elicits no response due to catalytic reactions, and the entity is then able to become co-Creator of experiential occurrences. This is not indifference or objectivity but a finely tuned compassion that sees all things as love."

The positively oriented entity perceives the anger, blesses and loves this anger in itself, and then intensifies it consciously in mind alone -- until the folly of this red-ray energy is perceived, not as folly in itself, but as energy subject to spiritual entropy due to the randomness of energy being used. The other-self who was the object of anger is then transformed into an object of acceptance, understanding, and accommodation. The great energy that anger began is reintegrated and used."

This is the mechanism of what you call cancer: the random, undirected energy that neither the positive nor the negative path has claimed, turning inward upon the body itself. The catalyst of experience is designed to offer experience. If neither path is chosen, the catalyst fails in its design."

Spiritual and mental blockages combined with mental and bodily blockages may affect each center in several differing ways. The balancing and evolutionary process is subtle beyond what simple models can capture. But the principle is clear: experience the catalyst, observe the response, discover its opposite within, and through this conscious practice, allow the center to clear."
