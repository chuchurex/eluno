The entity examines the anger fully, feeling its heat, understanding its roots, until the nature of this energy becomes clear. Anger, seen with full awareness, reveals itself as misdirected passion — energy subject to entropy when left unexamined. Through this process, the other-self who triggered the anger becomes an object not of resentment but of acceptance and understanding.

The conscious mind cannot simply reach down and access the unconscious at will."

When catalyst arrives and the conscious mind engages with it — feeling it fully, examining it honestly, sitting with its discomfort — a doorway opens between the conscious and the unconscious. Through that doorway, the catalyst passes into the deeper mind, where it can be transformed into experience and eventually crystallized as wisdom. Without catalyst, the doorway remains closed. Without conscious engagement with catalyst, the doorway opens only partially, and much of the offered learning is lost."

When catalyst is refused — when the conscious mind turns away from difficult experience — the bridge between the surface and the depths is never crossed. The Potentiator remains untouched, and the catalyst either returns in another form or passes to the body. The design is elegant but unforgiving: the only way through is through."
