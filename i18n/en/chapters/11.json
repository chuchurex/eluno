The lower energy centers -- the first triad of red, orange, and yellow -- receive catalyst that has to do with survival, identity, and social relation. This is the infrastructure, the baseline. But the higher centers gain their catalyst from the biases of the self in response to all random and directed experience. The less conscious entity perceives everything in terms of survival. The more conscious entity begins to transform basic catalyst into material for the higher centers -- material for love, for wisdom, for service."

There is no lack of time in which catalyst may work."

Every physical sensation, every illness, every moment of bodily comfort or discomfort carries information. The seeker who listens to the body with the same attention given to meditation or study will find a teacher that never lies and never tires."
