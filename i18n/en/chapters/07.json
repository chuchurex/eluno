Each density unfolds within a great cycle of approximately seventy-five thousand years, divided into three sub-cycles of roughly twenty-five thousand years each. At the close of each sub-cycle, a harvest may occur -- an opportunity for those who have progressed sufficiently to move forward. At the end of the full master cycle, all are harvested, regardless of their progress, for the planet itself has moved through the useful portion of that vibratory configuration."
