Without {term:balance}, the seeker's progress may be undermined by energies that remain unexamined within the self. We turn now to the specific work of balancing and healing -- the inner technologies that transform understanding into wholeness."

The objective of the balancing work is not the smooth flow of feeling but rather the quality of becoming unswayed. This is a simpler result, and it takes much practice."

When the seeker encounters difficulty -- a harsh word, a betrayal, a loss -- and can see within that difficulty the face of the Creator, the difficulty ceases to carry its former charge. Not because the seeker has suppressed the response, but because the response itself has changed. Where once there was reaction, now there is recognition."

Only then does the acceptance become real rather than merely spoken."

The distortions, the blockages, the patterns of suffering -- these are real within the illusion, and they deserve the seeker's full attention and care. But beneath them lies a being that was never damaged. The work of balancing and healing is the work of clearing away what obscures this truth, not of constructing something that was not there before."

When this incarnation ends, you will remember -- fully, gloriously -- who you are and why you came. The balancing, the healing, the slow and patient work of self-knowledge -- all of it serves this one purpose. Not to make you into something new, but to help you recall what you have always been."
