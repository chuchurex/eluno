That which is eternally complete chooses the journey toward completeness. That which is all chooses to forget its totality so that it might have the experience of remembering. This is not a deficiency seeking fulfillment. It is an abundance so vast that it overflows into exploration—the way a musician who has mastered every technique still finds joy in playing, not because anything is lacking, but because expression is the nature of mastery."

You are consciousness manifesting as this particular form, this particular life, this particular arrangement of memories and hopes. You are vibration condensed into flesh, light slowed to the frequency of a body that breathes and hungers and wonders. You are the cosmic experiment of Free Will in action—every choice you face is the Creator's experiment continuing through you. You are the co-Creator whose thoughts, even now, shape the subtle energies of the world you inhabit. And you are the purpose fulfilled: the Infinite knowing itself through your eyes, your hands, your heart."

It is something to recognize—the way you might recognize your own face in a mirror after a long time of looking elsewhere. The recognition may come in meditation, in a moment of unexpected unity with another being, in the silence between thoughts, in the sudden dissolving of the boundary between self and world. When it comes, it will not feel like learning something new. It will feel like remembering something you have always known."
