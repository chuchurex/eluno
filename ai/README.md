# AI-Assisted Writing Documentation

This project was created with AI assistance (Claude by Anthropic). In the spirit of transparency and reproducibility, we document our methodology here.

## 📚 Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)** | 5-step guide to replicate this book (start here!) |
| **[AI_WRITING_PROMPT.md](./AI_WRITING_PROMPT.md)** | Complete system prompt and instructions |
| **[METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md)** | Editorial decisions, iterations, and lessons learned |
| **[SOURCES.md](./SOURCES.md)** | Direct links to source PDFs (Ra Contact, Q'uo) |
| **[docs_ai_README.md](./docs_ai_README.md)** | Human-AI collaboration model explained |

## 🎯 Quick Links

**Want to replicate this book?** → Start with [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)

**Need the source PDFs?** → See [SOURCES.md](./SOURCES.md) for direct download links

**Understanding the process?** → Read [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md)

## Why We Share This

1. **Transparency**: Readers deserve to know how the content was created
2. **Reproducibility**: Others can replicate, improve, or create similar projects
3. **Contribution**: Clear guidelines help contributors maintain consistency
4. **Trust**: Open methodology builds trust in the final product

## The Human Role

While AI assisted with writing, a human (Carlos Martínez) provided:

- **Philosophical direction** and doctrinal oversight
- **Editorial decisions** on voice, tone, and terminology
- **Quality control** and accuracy verification against source material
- **Cross-traditional research** connecting Ra's teachings to other wisdom traditions
- **Final approval** of all content

The AI served as a writing tool, not as an autonomous author.

## How It Works

1. **Source Material**: The Ra Contact (1981-1984) serves as the sole authority
2. **Transformation**: Q&A format → Narrative prose organized by theme
3. **Voice**: First-person plural ("we") as philosophical/sapiential perspective
4. **Fidelity**: Every concept traces back to the original Ra Material
5. **Accessibility**: Complex metaphysics in clear, modern language

## 🚀 Replicating This Project

Follow [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md) for setup and usage. The pipeline runs entirely in Claude Code using slash commands (`/write:chapter N`).
