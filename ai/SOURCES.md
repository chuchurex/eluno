## Source hierarchy

| Priority | Source | Use in final text |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Ra Contact Vol 1-2** | Paraphrased (never quoted directly) |
| 2 | **Q'uo Archives Vol 9-11** | Never appears in final text |
| 3 | **Cross-traditional references** | As enrichment (Kabbalah, Vedanta, etc.) |
| 4 | **Modern science** | When naturally relevant |

**Golden rule**: Q'uo helps you understand Ra. Ra is the book's only voice.
