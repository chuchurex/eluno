## RELACIÓN CON CAPÍTULOS ADYACENTES
### ← Ch13 ya estableció:
- Free will as the primary law — the entity must choose for itself
- The faculty of will strengthened through engaging with confusion
- Faith under conditions of genuine uncertainty
- Service without control or imposition
- The calling as the mechanism through which help becomes available
- Type F closure affirming "You are the Creator, choosing"

### → Ch15 profundizará:
- Balancing and Healing — Ra's specific balancing technique
- Working with distortions
- Physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual healing
- The healer and the healed
- Acceptance as healing

### Por tanto, Ch14 debe:
- Be the most practical chapter yet — Level 3 application throughout (Part V)
- Show HOW to walk the path that previous chapters described theoretically
- Present meditation, service, and faith as living practices, not abstract ideals
- Bridge from Ch13's "you must choose" to Ch15's "here is how to balance and heal"
- Use tentative language that respects free will — "the seeker may find" not "you must"
- Close with Type E (Action) — a soft call to action that invites engagement

## LECCIONES DEL QA (from Ch13)
- Check for "Law of One" as attribution early — easy to slip in as concept name
- Second-half sections in Ch13 ran shorter (~440 avg vs ~585 first half) — allocate more depth to second-half sections
- Cat D repetitions tend to happen across the writing split boundary — read draft-first carefully before writing second half
- Verify {ref:} against references.json before using
- {term:} only once per chapter
- Avoid "judgment" (use "discernment", "assessment")
- Part V requires Level 3 application — entire sections dedicated to practice
