## CAPÍTULOS ANTERIORES (leer antes de escribir)
- Leer: `i18n/en/chapters/11.json`
- **Ch11 cubrió:** Catalyst and Experience — what catalyst is, programmed vs random catalyst, using catalyst consciously, when catalyst goes unused, the role of suffering, from experience to wisdom, relationships as catalyst, the catalyst of the body
- **NO repetir:**
  - The definition of catalyst (ch11-what-catalyst-is)
  - Pre-incarnative programming of catalyst in detail (ch11-programmed-catalyst)
  - The acceptance/control mechanism for processing catalyst (ch11-conscious-use)
  - Karma as inertia (ch11-suffering)
  - The deep mind as repository (ch11-catalyst-to-wisdom) — mentioned but not defined here
- **PUEDE profundizar:**
  - Ch11 closed with Type D (Bridge → Ch12): "There is a deeper intelligence at work — one that has been with you before this life began and will be with you after it ends. The one who programmed the catalyst, who chose the themes, who watches from the far side of time."
  - Ch11 mentioned pre-incarnative choice — Ch12 reveals WHO makes those choices (the Higher Self)
  - Ch11 mentioned the deep mind and intuition briefly — Ch12 explores dreams and intuition as channels of guidance
  - The "card game" metaphor in Ch11 — Ch12 can reference the player who knows the game but cannot play it for you

## RELACIÓN CON CAPÍTULOS ADYACENTES
### ← Ch11 ya estableció:
- Catalyst as the raw material of spiritual evolution
- Pre-incarnative choice (definition and purpose)
- The deep mind as repository of processed experience
- Intuition as "the whisper of accumulated wisdom"
- Bridge closure pointing directly to Ch12: "the one who programmed the catalyst"

### → Ch13 profundizará:
- Free Will as the primary law governing guidance (why the Higher Self cannot override your choices)
- The Law of Confusion — why guidance must be indirect
- The paradox of asking for help vs preserving free will
- Why higher beings do not intervene directly

### Por tanto, Ch12 debe:
- Reveal the Higher Self as the "deeper intelligence" Ch11 pointed to — the programmer of catalyst
- Explain the temporal paradox: your future self guides your present self
- Show guidance as a spectrum from dreams to intuition to synchronicities
- Establish that all guidance respects free will (setup for Ch13's exploration of why)
- Close with Type C (Love/Presence) — affirming the reader's connection to their own Higher Self

## LECCIONES DEL QA
- Avoid "judgment" (triggers terminology validator — use alternatives)
- Thematic overlap between sections covering similar mechanisms requires careful differentiation (lesson from Ch11)
- With 8 sections, each must have a clearly distinct angle
- Verify {ref:} against references.json before using
- {term:} only once per chapter
- Part IV requires Level 2 practical application — integrate application paragraphs organically
- "The instrument" as substring — avoid
