## RELACIÓN CON CAPÍTULOS ADYACENTES
### ← Ch14 ya estableció:
- Meditation as foundation for all inner work
- Acceptance of self as prerequisite for discipline
- The faculty of will directed in service
- Faith as sustained act of will under uncertainty
- Perseverance — daily practice, consistency over intensity
- Type E closure: "Use what you have been given"

### → Ch16 profundizará:
- The Mystery Remains — what cannot be known in third density
- Humility before the Infinite
- The endless journey
- Final words and invitation to continued exploration

### Por tanto, Ch15 debe:
- Be fully Level 3 application — entire sections dedicated to balancing and healing practice
- Show the SPECIFIC techniques: Ra's balancing exercise, working with distortions, healing others
- Bridge from Ch14's general seeker practices to the specific inner technologies of balancing and healing
- Present healing as flowing from acceptance, not from control — reinforcing Ch14's key insight
- Develop the healer/healed dynamic as one of the deepest expressions of service
- Close with Type F (Recognition) — the ultimate healing is remembering who you are

## LECCIONES DEL QA (from Ch14)
- "the instrument" triggers attribution validator — prefer "tool" or rephrase
- Check for "God" early — "Logos" is the correct substitute per protocol
- Practical chapters (Part V) tend to run shorter (~4,400 words) — expand heart sections if needed
- Cat D repetitions tend to happen across the writing split boundary — read draft-first carefully before writing second half
- Verify {ref:} against references.json before using
- {term:} only once per chapter
- Avoid "judgment" (use "discernment", "assessment")
- Part V requires Level 3 application — entire sections dedicated to practice
