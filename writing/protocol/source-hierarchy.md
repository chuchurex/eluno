| 1 | **Ra Contact Vol 1-2** | âœ… Paraphrased (never quoted directly) |
| 2 | **Q'uo Archives Vol 9-11** | âŒ NEVER appears in final text |
| 3 | **Cross-traditional references** | âœ… As enrichment (Kabbalah, Vedanta, etc.) |
| 4 | **Modern science** | âœ… When naturally relevant |

**Golden Rule**: Q'uo helps you understand Ra. Ra is the book's only voice.
